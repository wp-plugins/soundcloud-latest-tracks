This plugin simply allows you to choose a Soundcloud user and display an x amount of latest tracks from that user using a nice lil' shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin is to fill the hole in the Wordpress plugin directory where users wish to show their latest X amount of tracks on X amount of rows each row being an embedded Soundcloud player.

The user will also have the option to add a "hear more" button to get the next X amount of tracks from the chosen Soundcloud user.

The reason I find this better than embedding a single Soundcloud player (that plays multiple tracks) is that users will be interacting more with the site instead of heading off to Soundcloud and also get a better sense of your website's style with my plugin rather than a player you slapped on the site. 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `soundcloud-latest-tracks` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3.1 Now you can use the shortcode in any piece of text on the site:

	[soundcloud_latest_tracks user="YOUR_SOUNDCLOUD_USER_ID" show="NUMBER_OF_TRACKS_SHOWN" hear_more="YES_OR_NO"]
3.2 You can also use the widget name "Soundcloud Latest Tracks Widget" and fill in the same attributes as above.
